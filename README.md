# Electronics-Projects-Tinkercad-
This repository contains some electronics projects that I created digitally using Tinkercad software.
I encourage you to try building these projects physically for a hands-on experience. However, if the cost of the components is a concern, you can also create and practice these projects digitally using Tinkercad.
Just practice, learn, and enjoy exploring electronics!
